# Basic React

### What is React?
- React is a JavaScript pakage
- It is used to produce HTML and show them to user
- When we write React, we are writing individual Components or Views
- What are components or views? Like I said, they are something that produce HTML. They are a collection of JavaScript functions that create HTML. 
- All the components will be nested together to build a complex web page

### How React works?
- Basic idea is, webpack and babel will translate all the es6, JSX, react stuff into es5 (vanilla Javascript). Because Browser only understand es5. Then the browser can make it webpage

### JSX
- Look like inside HTML, but a dialect of Javascript. 
### Render
- When I say Render, it means put the HTML on to the page
